# Sainofirst SDK 

The Sainofirst SDK for node js provides a node js API for Sainofirst services. You can use the node js API to build libraries or applications for node js. 

Using the SDK for node js makes it possible to realize a number of compelling use cases. their are several things you can build by using the SDK for node js.


## Setting Up the SDK for node js

### Installing the SDK

The preferred way to install the Sainofirst SDK for node js is to use the ```npm``` package manager for node js. 

Go to your node js project directory.

```bash
cd your_project_directory
```

Then simply type the following into a terminal window

```bash
npm install sainofirst 
```
This will install the Sainofirst SDK into your node js project.

### Loading the SDK

After you install the SDK, you can load the Sainofirst SDK in your node js application using require. 

```js
const Sainofirst = require("sainofirst")
```

## Configure Your Credentials

You need to provide credentials to Sainofirst SDK so that only your account and its resources are accessed by the SDK. For more information about obtaining your account credentials, see [Getting Your Credentials](https://apidocs.sainofirst.com/authentication-api-key). 

To hold this information, we recommend you create an environment variable with SAINOFIRST_API_KEY as it's key and it's value should hold your Sainofirst api key.

```bash
SAINOFIRST_API_KEY=your_sainofirst_api_key
```

Alternatively if you prefer you can set your credentials directly in code (NOT RECOMMENDED)

> We do not recommend hard coding your Sainofirst credentials in your scripts. Hard coding credentials poses a risk of exposing your api key. 


```js
const sf = new Sainofirst("YOUR API KEY")
```

## Working with Sainofirst SDK

The Sainofirst SDK for node js provides access to services that it supports through a collection of service instances. Each supported Sainofirst service offer low-level APIs for using service features and resources.

The services exposed through the SDK for node js follow the request-response pattern to exchange messages with calling applications. In this pattern, the code invoking a service submits an HTTP/HTTPS request to an endpoint for the service. The request contains parameters needed to successfully invoke the specific feature being called. The service that is invoked generates a response that is sent back to the requestor. The response contains data if the operation was successful or error information if the operation was unsuccessful. 

> Not all services are immediately available in the SDK

Array of current services available under this version of SDK
- sms
- voice


When using the SDK for node js, you add the SDK package to your application using require, which provides support for all current services. 


### Accessing Sainofirst  Services
importing the SDK for node js as shown previously includes the entire SDK into your code.


```js
const Sainofirst = require("sainofirst")
```

Begin by creating an instance of the Sainofirst SDK and assign it to a variable.

```js
const sf = new Sainofirst()
```

To access service features through the Sainofirst class, you first access a service through which you access a set of features provided by the underlying service instance. Generally there is one service instance provided for each service.

Consider the following code used to access sms service

```js
const sms = sf.sms
```
### Accessing Individual  Services

To access individual service begin by importing that service

```js
const Sms = require("sainofirst/lib/services/sms")
```
creating an instance of the service and assign it to a variable.

```js
const sms = new Sms()
```

# Sms Service 

Programmatically send high volumes of text messages globally. Your users can get OTP, alerts, stock prices, account balance, transaction statements, discounts, offers and much more all over a message.

Sainofirst sms service provides easy api for sending and scheduling text messages which you can easily integrate in your node js application.

### Required configuration options for sms service

| ------     | -------- | -------- |
| senderid  | `String` | The registered and approved Sender name.|
| route     | `String` | Type of connectivity ex Global, Promotional, Transactional, etc.  |


## Using sms service

Begin by loading Sainofirst SDK into your node js project.

```js
const Sainofirst = require("sainofirst")
```

Create a new instance of Sainofirst SDK. Make sure you have configured your apikey in environment variable.

```js
const sf = new Sainofirst()
```

Access sms service from the SDK.

```js
const sms = sf.sms
```

Alternatively if you do not want to load whole sdk you can also access individual services. To access individual service begin by importing that service

```js
const Sms = require("sainofirst/lib/services/sms")
```
Create an instance of the service and assign it to a variable. Make sure you have configured your apikey in environment variable.

```js
const sms = new Sms()
```

Define a callback function which will get executed after recieving response from Sainofirst server.



```js
function callback(success, error){
    if (error) throw Error(error)
    console.log(success)
}
```
